# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset Analysis & Visualization

This is a beginner-friendly exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using the Titanic dataset. The project demonstrates how to clean, explore, and visualize real-world data using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, we analyze the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about:
- Passenger demographics
- Survival rates based on gender, class, and age
- Feature correlations

This serves as an excellent entry-level machine learning/data science portfolio project.
